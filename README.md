# Data Analytict
Data Analytics
* Descriptive (Explain what happened)
* Diagnostic (Explains why it happened)
* Predictive (Forecasts what might happen)
* Prescriptive (Recommends an action based on the forecast)

## Descriptive Analytics
Descriptive analytics refers to the interpretation of historical data to better understand changes that occur in a business. Descriptive analytics describes the use of a range of historic data to draw comparisons with other reporting periods for the same company (i.e. quarterly or annually) or with others within the same industry.
several things can help on descriptive analytics:
1. metrics (max, min, count avg, sum, mode, median, std deviation, unique values)
2. searching
3. filtering
4. interpreting result

## Diagnostic Analytics
Diagnostic analytics describes the techniques you will use to ask your data.
Diagnostic analytics is usually performed using such techniques as data discovery, drill-down, data mining, and correlations.

## Predictive Analytics
Predictive analysis is an analysis technique using current and past data patterns to find out whether the same pattern will repeat itself.

## Prescriptive Analytics
Prescriptive analytics is a form of data analytics that uses past performance and trends to determine what needs to be done to achieve future goals.
## Root causes 
"Root causes" are the fundamental factors or origins that lead to an event or issue. Identifying root causes is crucial for effectively addressing problems and preventing the recurrence of the same issues in the future.

# Data Storytelling
Data storytelling in data analytics is the process of presenting data analysis and insights in a narrative format using the Python programming language and its libraries. It involves steps such as data preparation, exploratory data analysis, visualization, as well as communicating the analysis results to stakeholders. The goal is to transform data analysis findings into a compelling story that is engaging and easily understood, thus providing valuable insights and supporting decision-making.

# Corelation
Positive Correlation: Positive correlation occurs when the value of one variable increases, and the value of another variable tends to increase as well. In a scatterplot, the data points tend to form an upward pattern. A correlation value close to +1 indicates a strong positive relationship between variables, while a value close to 0 indicates a weak positive relationship.
Negative Correlation: Conversely, negative correlation occurs when the value of one variable increases, but the value of another variable tends to decrease. In a scatterplot, the data points tend to form a downward pattern. A correlation value close to -1 indicates a strong negative relationship between variables, while a value close to 0 indicates a weak negative relationship.

# Paired T-Test
T-test is a statistical tool used to compare the means of two groups. There are several types of t-test, the most common are:
1. Independent T-Test: Used when you want to compare the means of two different groups independently. For example, you want to know if there is a difference in average test scores between male and female students.
2. Paired T-Test: Used when you want to compare the means of two groups that are the same, but measured at two different times or conditions. For example, you want to know whether a particular therapy improves patient test scores before and after treatment.
When you do a t-test, you have two hypotheses put forward:
* Null Hypothesis (H0): This states that there is no significant difference between the two groups being compared.
* Alternative Hypothesis (H1): This states that there is a significant difference between the two groups being compared.
The t-test results provide two main outputs:
1. T-Statistic: This is a measure of how big the difference is between the means of two groups in standard units.
2. P-Value: This is the probability of observing a t-statistic value that is that large or more extreme if the null hypothesis is true. The smaller the p value, the stronger the evidence you have to reject the null hypothesis.

In t-test analysis, you usually set a prior significance level (usually 0.05) as a threshold to determine whether the results are statistically significant. If the p value is less than this threshold, you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the two groups being compared. However, if the p value is greater than that threshold, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, which means there is not enough evidence to say there is a significant difference.

# Regression Analysis
Regression Analysis
Regression analysis is a statistical technique used by data analysts to understand the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps in predicting the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

For example, let's say you're a data analyst working for an e-commerce company, and you want to understand how the amount a customer spends (dependent variable) is related to various factors such as age, gender, and number of previous purchases (independent variables).
